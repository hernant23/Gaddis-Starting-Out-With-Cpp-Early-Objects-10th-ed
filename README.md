****Chapter 16 - Exceptions & Templates****

1. String Bound Exceptions:

Write a class BCheckString that is derived from the STL string class.
This new class will have two member functions:
A. A BCheckString(string s) constructor that receives a string
object passed by value and passes it on to the base class
constructor.
B. An char operator[](int k) function that throws a
BoundsException object if k is negative or is greater than or
equal to the length of the string. If k is within the bounds of
the string, this function will return the character at position k
in the string.
You will need to write the definition of the BoundsException class. Test
your class with a main function that attempts to access characters
that are within and outside the bounds of a suitably initialized
BCheckString object.
